    <h2>Lizey</h2>
    <p class="txt">My name is Lizey Rowden. I'm studying Technology Management with a minor in cybersecurity
        and a minor in business graduating in May 2023. On September 23rd, I'm getting my Aggie Ring,
        and I'm so excited. I have a cat named Amos who was adopted a little over a year ago - he's the
        best. I have two sisters - all three of us have attended TAMU. Some of my hobbies include
        working out, hanging out with friends and family, and learning new things.</p>

        <p class="txt">Howdy! My name is Braden Alexander, and I am a member of the Class of 2023, majoring in
            Technology Management with a minor in Business and Cybersecurity. I am from Jacksonville,
            Texas which is in the East Texas area about 20 minutes south of Tyler, Texas. I am a
            programming director for the Applet Aggieland Visitor Center on campus. So I give tours and do
            some overnight events that high schools come down to learn more about our great university. I
            am also a member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band on the Bugle Rank so look out for me at the
            front rank of the band at halftime! </p>

        <h2>Jacob</h2>
        <p class="txt">Howdy, my name is Jacob, and I am a senior Technology Management student with a minor in Business and plan to
            graduate in spring of 2023. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas and while I don't want to live in
            downtown Houston, would like to stay in the Texas region. Some of my hobbies include Longboarding,
            Video games, and playing Guitar. I have a wonderful wife Caitlin who I've known since 4th grade and she
            just got a job as the County Extension Agent for Jasper County! Some professional interests of mine are
            Data Science/Analytics, System Administration, IT Service Management, and Web Development. Right now I have
            an internship and job lined up with Sysco food working in their BT Integrated planning team to support the
            Business team with the technologies they need to run the operation. I will be taking on a functional
            analyst role where I hope to further my technical and business skills to become a valuable asset and
            grow my career.</p>

		<h2>Ethan</h2>
        <p class="txt">Howdy, my name is Ethan Avila and I am a senior Technology Management major and plan on graduating in Spring
            2023. I have lived in College Station for my whole life, but plan on moving out once my girlfriend and I
            graduate. The kind of career I plan to develop once I graduate is either in IT, as a technician or as an
            administrator, or in Cybersecurity. I recently adopted a 5 month old cat named Pepper, who likes to crawl
            all over my keyboard while I'm using it. Some hobbies of mine include video games, paleontology, biking,
            and Magic: The Gathering. </p>
