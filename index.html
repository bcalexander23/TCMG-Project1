    <p class="txt">The purpose of this project is to showcase the struggles of this old style of I.T. and how it can
	cause communication barriers between the developer team and the operations team. Our goal is
	to make sure our output is the same on both ends. Our project consisted of a developer and operations team where
    the developers were in charge of writing working code and operations were in charge of implementing the code into
    a live environment for access by the web.</p>
